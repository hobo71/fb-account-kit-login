### Features

 * **Login with SMS** (Phone).
 * **Login with WhatsApp**.
 * **Login with Email**.
 * **Full WooCommerce Support**.
 * Totally **Free of Cost SMS Service**.
 * **Shortcode** Compatible.
 * Dedicated **Widget**.
 * **Compatible with Jetpack** Login.

 * **Easy Migration** from **DIGITS** Plugin.
 
### This is how it works:

* Instead of asking users for a username and password when they try to log in to your website, it simply asks them for their phone number or email.
* Account Kit servers send an SMS with a confirmation code to the phone number (or WhatsApp Account) or send an email with a confirmation link to the email address to continue the login.
* If users fail to receive the SMS code, it offers two other methods that people can choose from the Phone call or Facebook notification.
* The SDK verifies the SMS confirmation code or monitors the status of the confirmation email. Account Kit may also verify the phone number directly without sending an SMS code.
* After successful verification of that authentication this plugin creates the log in WordPress cookie, successfully authenticating the user if the user alredy exists. Otherwise it will create a new user which depends upon plugin settings.
